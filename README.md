## Hello, It's Meeta Haldar ✨

In school, I had no idea about coding. But when I enrolled in B.Tech IT, subjects like Programming, OS, DBMS, and DSA sparked my curiosity, and I was instantly hooked.

My first milestone was an internship as a Full Stack Developer in college, where I gained hands-on experience. I also participated in hackathons, choosing tech over sports.

After graduation, I joined GeeksforGeeks as an MTS, solving technical issues, optimizing the write portal, and building secure APIs. Alongside this, I solved 500+ LeetCode problems, sharpening my problem-solving skills.

To take things further, I founded DOMTracker, a platform for web development services and daily tech updates. From knowing nothing about coding to building products, my journey has been incredible—and it’s just the beginning. 🚀
