In school, I had no idea about coding or the world of programming. It was something I had never explored or even thought about.

Everything changed when I enrolled in B.Tech IT. That‚Äôs where I was introduced to subjects like Programming, OS, DBMS, and DSA‚Äîand I was instantly hooked. The logic, the problem-solving, and the creativity behind building software fascinated me. I found myself deeply engaged, excited to learn more every day.

My first milestone came when I landed an internship as a Full Stack Developer during college. That experience gave me hands-on exposure to real-world projects and reinforced my passion for web development.

Beyond academics, I actively participated in hackathons, pushing my limits in coding challenges and innovation. While others focused on sports, I found my thrill in tech competitions.

After graduation, I joined GeeksforGeeks as an MTS, where I tackled technical issues, optimized the write portal, and built secure RESTful APIs to enhance user experience. Working on a platform that helps millions of developers sharpen their skills was an incredibly fulfilling journey.

Wanting to take things a step further, I launched my own startup, DOMTracker‚Äîa platform dedicated to web development services and daily technical updates. My goal is to help developers stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape while delivering top-notch web solutions.

From having no idea about coding to building products and solving real-world problems, this journey has been nothing short of exciting. And it‚Äôs only just beginning. üöÄ
